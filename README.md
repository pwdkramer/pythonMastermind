Codecademy portfolio project 1 - Mastermind in Python
Author: Patrick Kramer

A small terminal version of the game Mastermind to help me get used to Python syntax

INSTRUCTIONS:
Simply run the main.py file with python in your terminal.
You can also copy and paste the code into a website like replit.com as a python project and use a virtual command line.

GAMEPLAY:
The program will generate a random "code" chosen randomly from the colors Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow.
If the user chooses the "hard" difficulty instead of "normal", there will also be the option of Black and White.
You have 10 turns to guess the sequence of 4 random colors.
After each guess the program will tell you how many pins are the correct color and in the correct position,
as well as how many are the correct color and in the wrong position.
However, it does not specify which pins these clues apply to.

Once you use all 10 turns or correctly guess the secret code the game is over.
Good luck!
